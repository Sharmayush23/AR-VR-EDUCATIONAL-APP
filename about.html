<h1>STORY</h1>
<P>Dilpreet singh and Rupesh Kumar met in their freshman year of college, both pursuing degrees in computer science . we quickly discovered our shared passion for technology and virtual reality, and began brainstorming ways to bring immersive experiences to more people.

    Over the next few months, we spent countless hours coding and prototyping a virtual reality platform that could be accessed from anywhere, using just a smartphone and a simple VR headset.  
    . we had developed a virtual reality platform that was easy to use, affordable, and provided high-quality educational and adventure experiences.
    
    Excited by the possibilities of our invention, we decided to turn it into a business. 
    we spent the next few months refining their product, raising funds, and building a team of like-minded individuals who shared their vision.
  we continue to drive innovation in the virtual reality space, inspired by the limitless possibilities of the technology and the impact it can have on people's lives
